## Why?

because we do not have time to operate a full web server anymore and on the other hand we do not want all the stuff lost ...


## Active projects

there are two active THC projects with their own github repository:

 * thc-hydra: [https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra)
 * thc-ipv6: [https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-ipv6](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-ipv6)


## So?

Have fun with it - over 20 years of HPAV fun and research :)
